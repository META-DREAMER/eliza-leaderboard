["IC_kwDOMT5cIs6SN4Nh", "I_kwDOMT5cIs6cziSb", "Based on the CI errors, there are several issues that need to be addressed. \n\nThe main problems are:\n1. Module resolution and file extensions\n2. Incorrect usage of BigNumber constructor\n3. Incorrect usage of youtube-dl-exec\n4. Missing type definitions\n5. Node version compatibility\n\nHere are the suggested fixes:\n\n1. **Module Resolution Issues**\nThe TypeScript compiler is complaining about missing file extensions in imports when using Node16/NodeNext module resolution. You need to add `.js` extensions to relative imports. For example:\n\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport { Something } from '../core/types'\n\n// After\nimport { Something } from '../core/types.js'\n```\n\n2. **BigNumber Construction Issues**\nThere are multiple errors related to BigNumber construction from the bignumber.js package. The correct way to use it is:\n\n```typescript\n// Before\nnew BigNumber(value)\n\n// After \nBigNumber(value) // or\nnew BigNumber.BigNumber(value)\n```\n\n3. **YouTube DL Exec Issues**\nThe youtube-dl-exec package is not being called correctly. You need to use its default export:\n\n```typescript\n// Before\nyoutubedl(url, options)\n\n// After\nyoutubedl.default(url, options)\n```\n\n4. **PDF.js Types Issue**\nMissing type definitions for pdfjs-dist. Add the types to devDependencies:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/pdfjs-dist\": \"^2.10.378\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere are the specific files that need updates:\n\n1. Update tsconfig.json to handle module resolution:\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node16\",\n    \"allowImportingTsExtensions\": true,\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\n    \"allowJs\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. Update CI workflow to use the correct Node version:\n\n```17:20:.github/workflows/ci.yaml\n            - uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n              with:\n                  node-version: \"23\"\n                  cache: \"pnpm\"\n```\n\nChange to:\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n  with:\n    node-version: \"22\"\n    cache: \"pnpm\"\n```\n\n3. Add script to fix extensions:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nfind src -type f -name \"*.ts\" -exec sed -i 's/from \"\\(\\.\\.?\\/.*\\)\"/from \"\\1.js\"/g' {} +\n```\n\n", "2024-11-02T19:59:03Z", "2024-11-02T19:59:03Z", "sirkitree", "2025-04-09 22:28:33"]
